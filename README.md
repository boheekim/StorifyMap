The purpose of this project was to show two Storify stories with geolocated Tweets overlaid on the same map. The stories are displayed in the panes on the left. I chose to curate Tweets from two presidential candidates, Hillary Clinton (blue markers) and Jeb Bush (red markers). Click on the red and blue markers to see the Tweet in line with the rest of the story. I think if further developed, this could be a great way to view data around anything that is a comparison or versus story, like the upcoming 2016 elections.
